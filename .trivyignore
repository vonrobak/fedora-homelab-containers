# Trivy Ignore File - Filter False Positive Vulnerabilities
# Created: 2025-12-15
# Purpose: Reduce noise from vulnerabilities that are not exploitable in containers
#
# Reference: https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/docs/configuration/filtering/
#
# Format:
#   CVE-ID                    - Ignore specific CVE
#   CVE-ID exp:2025-12-31     - Ignore until expiration date
#   # comment                 - Comments for documentation

# ==============================================================================
# Build-time Dependencies (Not Used at Runtime)
# ==============================================================================

# Linux kernel headers (linux-libc-dev) - containers use host kernel, not these headers
# These are compile-time dependencies only and pose no runtime risk
# Package: linux-libc-dev
# Justification: Build headers for kernel, container uses host kernel
# Impact: ~300 false positives in Vaultwarden alone

# Note: Trivy doesn't support package-based ignores directly in .trivyignore
# We'll filter these in the scan script post-processing instead

# ==============================================================================
# Known False Positives with Low/No Risk
# ==============================================================================

# Example: CVE-2023-45853 (zlib) - only exploitable if processing malicious ZIP files
# Keeping this for now as it's a real vulnerability, but low risk for most services
# CVE-2023-45853

# ==============================================================================
# Accepted Risks / Waivers
# ==============================================================================

# Add any CVEs you've assessed and accepted the risk for here
# Format: CVE-YYYY-XXXXX exp:YYYY-MM-DD  # Reason for acceptance

# ==============================================================================
# Placeholder
# ==============================================================================

# This file intentionally left mostly empty - we filter false positives
# programmatically in the scan script based on package names
# See: ~/containers/scripts/scan-vulnerabilities.sh
