# Current System State Analysis - 2025-10-22

## üìä What's Actually Working Right Now

### ‚úÖ Working Services

1. **Jellyfin** - FULLY FUNCTIONAL
   - URL: https://jellyfin.patriark.lokal
   - Status: Accessible without errors
   - Container: Running, healthy
   - Network: Connected to systemd-reverse_proxy
   - Authentication: None currently (direct access)

2. **Traefik** - PARTIALLY WORKING
   - Container: Running
   - Ports: 80, 443, 8080 all listening
   - Network: systemd-reverse_proxy
   - Routing: Working for Jellyfin ‚úÖ
   - Dashboard: NOT accessible on https://traefik.patriark.lokal ‚ùå

3. **DNS Resolution** - WORKING PERFECTLY
   - auth.patriark.lokal ‚Üí 192.168.1.70 ‚úÖ
   - jellyfin.patriark.lokal ‚Üí 192.168.1.70 ‚úÖ
   - traefik.patriark.lokal ‚Üí 192.168.1.70 ‚úÖ
   - Pi-hole resolving correctly

### ‚ùå Not Working Services

1. **Authelia** - BROKEN
   - Container: Crashes repeatedly (restart counter: 82+)
   - Error: "redis connection error: context deadline exceeded"
   - Root cause: Multi-network configuration issues
   - Status: In crash loop, not functional

2. **Authelia-Redis** - RUNNING BUT ISOLATED
   - Container: Running
   - Network: systemd-auth_services only
   - Problem: Authelia can't reach it reliably

3. **Traefik Dashboard** - NOT ACCESSIBLE
   - URL: https://traefik.patriark.lokal returns error
   - Likely cause: Router configuration references non-working Authelia

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Why Jellyfin Works But Traefik Dashboard Doesn't

**Jellyfin works because:**
- It has its own Traefik labels (from original setup)
- Doesn't require authentication (no middleware blocking it)
- Direct routing works: browser ‚Üí Traefik ‚Üí Jellyfin ‚úÖ

**Traefik dashboard doesn't work because:**
- Router configuration (in routers.yml) requires `tinyauth@docker` or `traefik-auth` middleware
- Middleware references Authelia (which is broken)
- When middleware fails, Traefik returns error
- Result: Can't access dashboard ‚ùå

### The Authelia Situation

**Timeline of issues:**
1. Original setup had Authelia working with Redis
2. Attempted to add SMTP support ‚Üí added smtp_password secret
3. Secret mounting syntax was wrong (file vs Podman secret confusion)
4. Fixed secret syntax ‚Üí Redis connection broke
5. Added multi-network support (auth_services + reverse_proxy)
6. Redis became unreachable due to network routing issues
7. Current state: Authelia in crash loop

**Technical problems:**
- Container multi-network complexity
- Podman secret vs file-based secret confusion
- Redis connection across network boundaries
- Configuration file complexity (200+ lines)
- Dependencies (Redis, secrets, networks, configs)
- Difficult to debug (cryptic errors)

## üéØ Evidence-Based Decision Framework

### Question 1: Do You Need Authentication at All?

**Consider:**
- Currently accessing only from home LAN (192.168.1.0/24)
- No internet exposure yet
- Jellyfin has its own built-in authentication
- You're the only user

**Scenarios:**

**A) LAN-only access forever:**
- No authentication needed
- UDM Pro firewall protects from outside
- Simpler, faster, nothing to break

**B) Future internet access:**
- Need authentication layer
- Protects services from public internet
- Adds complexity but necessary for security

**Your answer determines next steps.**

## üé≤ My Honest Assessment

### What I Think You Should Do:

**Option 1: BTRFS Rollback + Tinyauth (RECOMMENDED)**

**Reasoning:**
1. Your BTRFS snapshot has a working state
2. Jellyfin working proves infrastructure is solid
3. Authelia has consumed 3 days without success
4. Tinyauth is purpose-built for exactly your use case
5. 10 minutes to working auth vs more days of Authelia debugging

**Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Rollback to pre-Authelia state
sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot /home /home-before-tinyauth
sudo btrfs subvolume delete /home/@home
sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot /home-snapshot-from-before-authelia /home/@home
reboot

# 2. Setup Tinyauth (10 minutes)
# 3. Back to building homelab features
```

**Why this makes sense:**
- Clean slate with working foundation
- Modern solution purpose-built for Traefik
- Proven to work for others
- Your goal is homelab, not authentication expert
- Time better spent on other projects

---

**Option 2: Keep Current State, Add BasicAuth (FASTEST)**

**Reasoning:**
1. Jellyfin already works
2. Just need Traefik dashboard access
3. 5 minutes to working
4. Can always switch to Tinyauth later

**Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Remove broken Authelia references
# 2. Add BasicAuth to Traefik
# 3. Done in 5 minutes
```

**Why this makes sense:**
- Minimal changes to working system
- Gets you unblocked immediately
- Can evaluate other options later
- No rollback needed

---

**Option 3: Try Authelia One More Time (NOT RECOMMENDED)**

**Reality check:**
- 3 days of effort already invested
- Still broken after multiple fix attempts
- Complexity indicates this will keep happening
- Your time is valuable

**Only do this if:**
- You specifically want to learn Authelia internals
- You have another week to debug
- You enjoy troubleshooting complex systems
- Authentication is your hobby project
