# Documentation Update Summary - October 25, 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes the conflicts identified between the three homelab documentation files and the updates made to resolve them.

---

## Files Reviewed

1. **20251025-storage-architecture-authoritative-rev2.md** (Most recent, authoritative for storage)
2. **HOMELAB-ARCHITECTURE-DIAGRAMS.md** (Visual diagrams, dated Oct 23)
3. **HOMELAB-ARCHITECTURE-DOCUMENTATION.md** (Main documentation, dated Oct 23)

---

## Key Conflicts Identified

### 1. Directory Structure Discrepancies

**Issue:** Different directory names across documents
- **Authoritative (rev2):** Uses `~/containers/docs/`
- **Old diagrams/docs:** References `~/containers/documentation/`

**Resolution:** Updated to use `~/containers/docs/` consistently

### 2. Backup Directory Structure

**Issue:** Inconsistent backup directory descriptions
- **Authoritative (rev2):** Shows `~/containers/backups/` with note that it may be superfluous
- **Old docs:** Shows `~/containers/backups/phase1-TIMESTAMP/` and other subdirectories

**Resolution:** Clarified that config backups may be superfluous with BTRFS snapshots, simplified structure

### 3. Script Inventory and Status

**Critical Discovery:** The authoritative rev2 document contains detailed annotations about script status that were missing from other documents:

**Active Scripts:**
- `cloudflare-ddns.sh` - Working, runs every 30 minutes

**Scripts Needing Attention:**
- `collect-storage-info.sh` - Recent but has errors, needs revision
- `survey.sh` - Recent but buggy, needs revision
- `organize-docs.sh` - Needs revision for new data structure

**Legacy Scripts (Need Review/Archive):**
- `deploy-jellyfin-with-traefik.sh` - Probably legacy
- `fix-podman-secrets.sh` - Legacy, needs scrutiny
- `homelab-diagnose.sh` - Legacy, needs revision
- `jellyfin-manage.sh` - Legacy but useful, needs documentation
- `jellyfin-status.sh` - Same as above
- `security-audit.sh` - Legacy but may have valid checks
- `show-pod-status.sh` - Legacy status unclear

**Legacy Secrets (Can Remove):**
- `redis_password` - From failed Authelia experiment
- `smtp_password` - From failed Authelia experiment

**Resolution:** Added detailed script status annotations to updated documentation

### 4. Storage Architecture Details Missing

**Issue:** Old documents lacked critical storage information present in rev2:

Missing Information:
- Detailed BTRFS pool structure with 7 subvolumes
- Subvolume purposes and intended uses
- LUKS encryption details for backup drives
- NOCOW attributes for database storage
- Comprehensive snapshot strategy
- Storage mount options and rationale

**Resolution:** Fully integrated storage architecture from rev2 into both updated documents with:
- Complete subvolume listing and purposes
- Visual storage hierarchy diagram
- Data flow diagrams showing SSD vs HDD usage
- Snapshot retention policies
- Backup encryption strategy

### 5. Network Configuration

**Issue:** Incomplete network information
- **Rev2 shows:** `auth_services.network` exists but is idle with no services
- **Rev2 shows:** `media_services.network` exists for future use
- **Old docs:** Didn't clarify the idle status of these networks

**Resolution:** Clarified network assignments and purposes:
- `reverse_proxy.network` - All current services (active)
- `auth_services.network` - Idle, reserved for future
- `media_services.network` - Reserved for future media isolation

### 6. Cloudflare DDNS Implementation

**Conflict:** Uncertainty about implementation method
- **Rev2 note:** "with cron or systemd (do not remember) jobs to update every 30 mins"
- **Old docs:** Listed both `cloudflare-ddns.service` and `cloudflare-ddns.timer` in systemd directory

**Resolution:** Documented both possibilities, noting this needs verification:
- Script is at `~/containers/scripts/cloudflare-ddns.sh`
- Automation exists but implementation method (cron vs systemd timer) should be verified
- Runs every 30 minutes (confirmed)

### 7. Security Headers Configuration

**Issue:** Reference to security-headers-strict.yml with note "user needs help getting a deeper understanding of this"

**Resolution:** 
- Kept the reference
- Added it as a point for future documentation improvement
- Noted in next steps that security audit should include review of these headers

## Information Still Requiring Verification

### 1. DDNS Implementation Method
**Current Status:** Script exists and runs every 30 minutes
**Needs Verification:** Is it cron or systemd timer?
**How to Check:**
```bash
# Check for systemd timer
systemctl --user list-timers | grep cloudflare

# Check for cron job
crontab -l | grep cloudflare
```

### 2. Deprecated Directories/Files
**Items to Verify:**
- `~/containers/config/traefik/certs/` - Marked as deprecated, can it be removed?
- `~/containers/backups/` - Marked as potentially superfluous with BTRFS snapshots
- Legacy secrets (redis_password, smtp_password) - Can these be safely removed?

**Recommendation:** Create an archive directory before deleting anything

### 3. Script Functionality
**Scripts Needing Testing:**
- All scripts marked as "LEGACY" should be tested or archived
- Scripts marked as "BUGGY" should be debugged or rewritten
- `security-audit.sh` should be reviewed for valid checks before archival

---

## Recommended Next Actions

### Immediate (Documentation Phase)

1. **Verify DDNS Implementation**
   ```bash
   systemctl --user list-timers | grep cloudflare
   crontab -l | grep cloudflare
   ```

2. **Review and Archive Legacy Items**
   - Create `~/containers/scripts/archive/` directory
   - Move legacy scripts there with date stamp
   - Document which scripts were archived and why

3. **Initialize Git Repository**
   ```bash
   cd ~/containers
   git init
   # Create .gitignore
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: homelab configuration"
   ```

4. **Create .gitignore**
   ```
   secrets/
   */acme.json
   *.log
   backups/
   ```

### Short-term (Monitoring Phase)

5. **Deploy Monitoring Stack**
   - Prometheus
   - Grafana
   - Loki
   - Exporters (Node, cAdvisor)

6. **Create Service Dashboard**
   - Homepage or Heimdall
   - Configure service links
   - Add monitoring widgets

### Medium-term (Security Phase)

7. **Security Audit**
   - Review container configurations
   - Audit file permissions
   - Review security-headers-strict.yml
   - Test security controls

8. **Implement 2FA**
   - Add TOTP support to Tinyauth
   - Consider WebAuthn for hardware keys
   - Document 2FA setup process

### Long-term (Service Expansion)

9. **Deploy Nextcloud**
