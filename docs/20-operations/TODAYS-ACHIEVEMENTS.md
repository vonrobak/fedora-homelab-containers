# üéâ What We Accomplished Today

## October 22-23, 2025 - Epic Homelab Session

---

## üèÜ **Major Achievements**

### **1. Replaced Complex Authentication System**
**Before:** Authelia (2 containers, Redis, complex config, crashing)  
**After:** Tinyauth (1 container, simple config, rock solid)  
**Result:** Working SSO authentication across all services ‚úÖ

### **2. Configured Dynamic DNS**
**Setup:** Cloudflare DDNS with automatic updates  
**Result:** patriark.org always points to your home, updates every 30 minutes ‚úÖ

### **3. Internet Access Working**
**Setup:** Port forwarding, DNS, routing  
**Result:** Services accessible from anywhere in the world ‚úÖ

### **4. Security Implemented**
**Setup:** Tinyauth protecting all services  
**Result:** Login required for everything, encrypted connections ‚úÖ

## üéì **Lessons Learned**

### **What Worked:**
1. **Start simple** - Tinyauth vs Authelia proved this
2. **Incremental testing** - Test after each change
3. **Good documentation** - Critical for complex setups
4. **BTRFS snapshots** - Safety net for experimentation
5. **Patient troubleshooting** - Systematic approach wins

### **What Didn't Work:**
1. **Authelia** - Too complex for our needs
2. **Rushing** - Led to missed configuration issues
3. **Assuming DNS works** - Always verify DNS resolution

### **Key Insights:**
1. **Simpler is usually better** - Less to break
2. **DNS is everything** - Get it right first
3. **Logs tell the truth** - Read them carefully
4. **Backups save lives** - Always have a way back
5. **Community tools help** - Tinyauth, Traefik, Cloudflare all excellent
