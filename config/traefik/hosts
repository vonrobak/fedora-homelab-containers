# Static host mappings for Traefik backend services
# Forces DNS resolution to use reverse_proxy network IPs
#
# Context: Podman's aardvark-dns returns container IPs in undefined order.
# When DNS returns monitoring network IPs first, Traefik routes traffic
# through the wrong network, violating network segmentation.
#
# Solution: Override DNS resolution with static /etc/hosts entries pointing
# to reverse_proxy network IPs, ensuring correct routing.
#
# Convention: Static IPs use .69+ to avoid collision with dynamic IPAM range
