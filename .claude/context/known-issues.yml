# Known Issues - Expected Warnings and Acceptable Conditions
# Created: 2025-12-11
# Purpose: Document warnings that are expected/acceptable to prevent alert fatigue

known_issues:
  # W004: Swap usage high but below autonomous action threshold
  - code: W004
    message: "Swap usage high (>6289MB warning threshold but <75% action threshold)"
    reason: "System uses swap for inactive pages. Below autonomous action threshold (75% of ~47GB = 35GB). Autonomous cleanup will trigger if swap reaches 75%."
    suppress_until: "2025-12-31"  # Re-evaluate yearly
    suppress_in_reports: false    # Still show in reports, just marked as "known acceptable"
    added_date: "2025-12-11"

    notes: |
      Current swap: ~7800MB
      Warning threshold: 6289MB (20% of memory)
      Action threshold: ~35GB (75% of swap space)

      This is normal Linux behavior - the kernel swaps out inactive memory pages
      to free up RAM for active processes. As long as swap usage stays below 75%,
      no action is needed. If it reaches 75%, the resource-pressure.yml playbook
      will automatically clean caches and restart high-memory services.

  # Examples for future use:
  # - code: W002
  #   message: "Custom warning about expected behavior"
  #   reason: "Explanation of why this is acceptable"
  #   suppress_until: "2026-01-01"
  #   suppress_in_reports: true   # Completely hide from reports
  #   added_date: "2025-XX-XX"
  #   added_by: "username or script"
  #   notes: "Additional context or documentation"

# Usage Instructions:
#
# suppress_in_reports:
#   - false: Warning still appears in reports but marked as "KNOWN ISSUE"
#   - true: Warning completely suppressed from reports
#
# suppress_until:
#   - Set to a future date when the issue should be re-evaluated
#   - Use YYYY-MM-DD format
#   - Typically set to end of year or 6 months out
#
# Integration:
#   - homelab-intel.sh reads this file and tags warnings
#   - weekly-intelligence-report.sh marks known issues in output
#   - Discord webhooks add 🔕 emoji for suppressed warnings
#
# Best Practices:
#   - Document WHY an issue is acceptable, not just WHAT it is
#   - Include metrics/thresholds for reference
#   - Set reasonable suppress_until dates (not indefinite)
#   - Review quarterly to remove resolved issues
