# CrowdSec Log Acquisition Configuration
#
# Note: CrowdSec primary value comes from CAPI (Community API) which provides
# 5000+ known-bad IPs from the global CrowdSec community. Local log parsing
# is secondary and optional.
#
# Current setup: Minimal configuration (satisfies requirement for datasource)
# - Primary threat intel: CAPI (5000+ known-bad IPs from global community)
# - Local acquisition: Placeholder file source (no actual logs processed yet)
#
# Future enhancement: Configure actual log sources when needed
# Options: journald export to file, docker socket mount, or syslog
#
---
# Placeholder file source (satisfies CrowdSec's requirement for at least one datasource)
# Note: This file doesn't need to exist - CrowdSec will wait for it
